# Note-Taker

## Description

This is a note-taker application that allows a user to create and save notes. They are shown a landing page which instructs them to "Get Started" and then they can type a new note and save, or look at a previous note.

## Technologies

This application uses node.js, express.js, a uniqueID package, as well as additional starter code that include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Heroku was also used to deploy the live application.

## Future Development

Adding functionality for a user to be able to delete a note. Possibly functionality to sort notes by date and or category.
